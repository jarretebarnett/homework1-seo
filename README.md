01-HTML-Git-CSS Homework

Objective of the homework was to refactor and organize the code in an orderly and simplified fashion.

1.) In order to do that, the code was broken up into three sections (head, body, and footer). Within those sections were div classes that I renamed as section classes.

2.) The link for "Search Engine Optimization" was broken. Fixed it by adding a div id tag along with the div class tag designation.

3.) Improvised the title of the file in the head section to appear like a more professional site.

4.) Labeled the "Benefits" section as an aside tag.

5.) The footer tagged section was formerly within the body tagged section. Moved outside of the body section and made it its own.

6.) Shrunk the font size of the lettering in the footer to make it less conspicuous and more realisitic, and updated the year. Also increased the top and bottom margins.
